Read this if you’re traveling to Negril!!,"I recently stayed at Coco La Palm in Negril, and it was an incredible experience that I can’t stop raving about. Two years ago, I stayed at the Royalton in Negril, which was luxurious—most of my time was spent eating, drinking, and relaxing within the resort. But this time, opting for a local hotel like Coco La Palm completely changed my perspective. If you haven’t stayed in a regular hotel in Negril, you’re missing out—it’s the best way to immerse yourself in Jamaican culture and soak up the magic of the 7-mile beach every day.

We dove into the local scene, hitting up beach parties, bars, and reggae concerts, and met so many amazing people along the way. One local we befriended (now a close friend!) hooked us up with four affordable excursions and took us to the best hole-in-the-wall restaurants. Trust me, skip the all-inclusives in Negril—save your money and go for a beachfront hotel instead. I’ve done both, and the local vibe wins hands down.

And to anyone worried about safety: I was bar-hopping with friends until 2 a.m. without a single issue. Use common sense, and you’ll be fine—Negril felt completely safe to me. Sure, no place is 100% risk-free, but the “danger” people talk about is way overblown. Book that trip, ditch the resort bubble, and live a little!",72,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamaicaTourism/comments/1jdmq9c/read_this_if_youre_traveling_to_negril/
Negril Trip Report,"(Leaving this report in hopes of helping someone in the future, since you were all so helpful in planning our visit. Other travel subs ask for trip reports to avoid repeating the same advice, so maybe this sub may enjoy something like that.)

Us: young American family with kids 6 & 8, very experienced travelers, in the Negril area for 2 weeks end of December/beginning of January. 

We absolutely loved Negril. We went back and forth between the beach and the west end daily when we stayed in town, with some forays into the center. The landscape is incredibly beautiful. People are friendly and kind. There has been quite a bit of development and foreign investment, but it still has a relaxed fishing town vibe and it’s not too built up—do NOT tell your Tulum friends please!  We were generally among a mix of locals and tourists, which was refreshing for a tourist hot spot. They don’t restrict beach access and there are many local microbusinesses everywhere, which is so different from, say, Mexico or Puerto Rico, and makes the adventure less icky and more mutually beneficial. 

7 mile beach has earned its reputation as one of the finest in the world. In a word: perfect. Warm, gorgeous, gentle…the whole thing. The beach sellers are convenient, if pushy: the kids loved buying fresh fruit from Rasta women and dancing to the buskers playing Jimmy Cliff and Bob Marley all day, we enjoyed patties for lunch and coconut pies for dessert, and most of our souvenirs were bought from basket-makers and carvers on the beach. A lot has been said about their pushiness, and it can get annoying if you’ve got somewhere to be; I found that being very polite but firm in my “thank you not today” helped, as well as patronizing Rastas as much as possible, who are very chill.  My husband had a harder time going anywhere because of constant approaches to buy drugs, unless he had a kid with him. It’s a pushier vibe than Mexico but never felt scary or even particularly impolite.  In general I would prefer to contribute directly to locals’ living expenses instead of the investment portfolio of a multinational hospitality chain, so I was happy for the opportunity to buy things from lots of people instead of a hotel, which also meant many interesting conversations about their lives and livelihoods, so I think we all benefited.

The cliffs are beautiful and much quieter at night, although still plenty going on. The road is sketchy for walking but cabs aren’t expensive. The lighthouse was gorgeous. 

Lodging: We kept it simple this trip and just stayed in 2 places: Samsara in the West End (meh, do not recommend) and Zimbali way out at Canaan Mountain near Little London (amazing).  We also spent a lot of beach time at Legends because it is part of Samsara (avoid).

Transportation: after a lot of deliberation, we decided against renting a car on this trip, since we were only going a few places, and the roads in Jamaica are among the worst I’ve seen, plus the crime rate was a concern if we got lost.  This ended up being the right decision for us, as we saved over $1000 US by taking cabs, contributed directly to locals, learned a lot from our drivers (local context, history, regional differences, food, plants…), and got to go to some off-the-beaten-path gems that we wouldn’t have otherwise.

Behavior: folks value talkative politeness and REALLY appreciated our efforts to reciprocate. Taking a minute to ask how they are in any interaction helped. With the Rastas in particular, asking about their gardens or their sleep was very appreciated, but even with waiters and cashiers taking a moment to acknowledge their personhood led to a lot of interesting moments and absolutely got me better deals everywhere I went. Generally people were just as interested in us as we were in them, especially once we found something in common.  We were shocked at some tourists’ behavior, especially European tourists but also Americans, some of whom seemed completely comfortable treating people like wallpaper and saw no issue with pushing past elderly people or young children. Likewise with tipping, it doesn’t have to be a lot to make a big difference in someone’s day.  We were disappointed at the lack of tips we saw from others so ended up increasing our tips quite a bit. Including 10% gratuity on bills is great but there’s no guarantee the service actually gets that money, and 10% of cheap as hell is still cheap as hell, so why not throw in an extra $10 and make someone’s day? Remember that we’re visiting their place (and we earn 5-10 times what someone in our same profession earns in Jamaica).

Activities: we did some outings, all of which I recommend:
—We had a driver bring us to the Black River Crocodile Safari and YS falls for the day, which was an excellent trip. It gave us the opportunity to visit Black River a bit, which is an interesting historical town, plus a very enjoyable driving tour of the southwest, including grabbing awesome fried fish and bammy for dinner at the famous border strip near White House and various fruits from the farms and shacks in St Elizabeth. The pontoon boat ride was very scenic, if a little short, through gorgeous mangrove swamps and bullrushes with plenty of beautiful birds and crocodiles right around the boat. The crocodile nursery was a little depressing but it’s cool that they are raising and releasing them. YS falls was a beautiful waterfall with a series of pools that has been developed into an ecopark with natural fed swimming pools, a zip line, large lawns, a restaurant etc. It was not what we were expecting in terms of how developed it was, but it was very beautiful, perfect for a day of swimming, and full of locals when we went, which was a nice endorsement. My children were disappointed that the gift shop was full of Chinese schlock that I won’t buy but otherwise no one complained.  
—When we were at Zimbali we did the Rasta tour, a hike up the mountain with 2 Rastas to their house on a scenic vista, where they cooked us ital food and taught us about the plants and other interesting things; I am making this sound boring but it was easily one of the most fascinating things we have ever done as tourists. 
—On the beach, the glass bottom boat and snorkeling was fun, effortless, and inexpensive, although probably the least amazing of the things we did (but if you’ve never snorkeled at a reef before, go go go).  

Food: I could write 300 restaurant reviews, but we all have better things to do than write and read that. The synopsis is: I can’t imagine going all the way to Jamaica to eat hotel mediocrity at US prices and encourage you to check out the excellent food scene!  There are a million places to eat, ranging from extremely cheap to very expensive, and almost all of them are good. The best meal we ate was probably at Pushcart. The only mediocre meals we ate were at Samsara and Alfred’s. Basically everything was wonderful everywhere, although in all fairness we were mostly seeking out Jamaican food at reasonable prices in restaurants good enough for locals, so that may color my perceptions. 

Family friendly: very friendly, almost as good as Hawaii and better than Mexico.  People were very kind and respectful to the children. The drug dealers didn’t bother us and no one hit on me when they were within earshot. My kids are experienced adventurers so they work to fit in where they are, but we felt welcomed everywhere, even when we brought them to bars and nicer restaurants. Zimbali and YS Falls were particularly chill.  Some of the beach is a more adult vibe but when we moved over to where the locals hang out there were plenty of kids and they made friends and even picked up a bit of patois.",35,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamaicaTourism/comments/1huo72a/negril_trip_report/

What I wish I new about getting around in Jamaica,"This is what I learned about getting around in Jamaica. Please note that I am not Jamaican and I only spent 15 days there, but we would have seen a lot more if we had known this before getting there.

**Taxis**

A lot of sources will tell you to only take red plate taxis, and some will specify JUTA taxis. But they won’t tell you why, or that there is a difference.

So:

* White plates: regular private vehicles
* Red plates: Buses & taxis
* Green plates: Commercial vehicles

So if your hotel shuttle has a green plate, don’t worry, it makes sense. It means that it only shuttles clients back and forth and doesn’t pick people up from the street.

JUTA (Jamaica Union of Travellers Association ) means that this taxi is licensed to pick up tourists. Usually it means that they will quote you prices in USD, usually 20 or occasionally 10USD for local destinations and it can be up to 200USD or more if you want to get far away, for example from Negril directly to Treasure Beach.

These are chartered taxis and they will pick you up and take you directly there. They will not pick up other passengers. Usually JUTA is written somewhere on the taxi and I also have seen some have a Chartered sign in the windshield. They are often but not always the ones who will hustle you the most if you are in a touristy area.

Route Taxis also have a red plate but are not meant for tourists. They often have small text on the sides, in front the the front door that say where they operate but the likeliness of you being able to read these while they zip past is very low.

Route taxis basically go back and forth between 2 fixed points and pick up and let out people along the way. They will pick up as many people as they can fit, and often, they will fit more than you think possible. They have fixed starting and ending points, usually a gas station or a plaza and that end point can be start point of another route so you can hop off one and get on with the next leg of your journey. \[Edit- I was told it was not the reason: >!My understanding is that they could get in trouble for picking up tourists and.!<..\] we have been asked to get out a block before the end point because police were around.

You can also get on by standing on the sidewalk somewhere along their way and waving at them. Be sure to ask for a price before you get in and confirm destination to be sure they don’t try to make you pay chartered rates. I have paid anywhere from 140 to 360 JMD per person per segment, 200 is average.

For some reason, they will ask you where you are going and will resist telling you where THEY are going, which I found really weird, especially when I wanted to know what the end of the route was because I wasn’t sure. They are always in a hurry, because they don’t make money when they don’t pick up people. Sometimes a JUTA taxi may pick you up for Route taxi rate because they are empty, we even had a kind gentleman (hi Mike!) give us a free ride because he was running an errand while waiting for his chartered clients who were partying at Rick’s café.

**Local Buses**

Buses have a similar concept except they are bigger, fit more people and go further. They also can have different starting and end points than route taxis.

For example, you might have a bus that goes from Ocho Rios to MoBay but by route taxi you will have to do Ochi-Discovery Bay, D-Bay-Falmouth and Falmouth-MoBay for the same result. The main difference is the waiting time at each transfer.

When you get to a starting point, a lot of people will hustle you and try to make you get in. It’s worth having a look at their taxi to see if people are already sitting in it. The faster it fills in, the faster it leaves.

If you have trouble figuring out starting points, routes and rates, try asking hostel/resort employees or other sympathetic passerby. We got great tips from a guy getting off a bus and seeing all buses we were trying to flag down were full. He’s the one who told us about the route taxi alternative back to MoBay. Locals can also tell you about tips, such as some places where you need to point towards your destination because there are 2 bus routes that go by and they won’t stop if you point to the destination where they aren’t going. I have also had locals warm up to me considerably when I asked about route taxis because they see you aren’t snotty and trying to avoid the locals.

**Knutsford Express**

They have a website, you can see how many seats are left, you buy your tickets, you show up 30 minutes in advance, they will load your luggage under the carriage. Comfy, has bathroom, A/C, wifi may or may not work. Even when it said that there were no seats left I never say it really full.

If I was going pretty far, say MoBay/Kingston, I would 100% take the Knutsford, it’s pretty affordable and worry-free.

It may seem like they don’t go to your destination but pull out your map and compare the map with the destinations in the drop down (the site has no map and it’s kinda bare.) For example, the destination for Ocho Rios is called Drax Hall, not Ocho Rios and no Ocho Rios RIU. You can take a route taxi from Drax Hall to downtown Ochi easy peasy or take a chartered taxi if you aren’t ready for route taxis yet.

I have to note that we did this as 2 people with 2 backpacks each (1 carry on size, 1 personal item size) and I am not sure I would try route taxi hopping with full sized suitcases.

I hope this helps. And if anyone has corrections to make, I would like to read them.",27,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamaicaTourism/comments/1cqazjw/what_i_wish_i_new_about_getting_around_in_jamaica/
FAQ,"Here are some of the most common questions and answers about tourism in Jamaica. Please feel free to add questions and responses.

>Is it safe?

Jamaica has a high crime rate, but it is almost entirely targeted at Jamaicans, usually related to gang activities. Unless you get mixed up in drug trafficking, it's very unlikely that a tourist would be a victim of a serious crime. Still, be aware of your surroundings to avoid pickpockets in crowded areas or opportunistic robberies if you're wandering alone at night. For a detailed experience of a visitor traveling around the island, see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jamaica/comments/yxyjfk/i_visited_jamaica_and_it_was_way_safer_than_i/)

>Will it rain on my whole vacation?

Unless there is a major weather system, like a hurricane, the answer is no. The forecasts often show rain every day because there is a chance o rain, but it should only be for less than an hour in the afternoon, if at all.

>How do I get marijuana?

Someone will offer it to you for sure, at any resort, probably at 10x the normal price. If you want to be sure of the quality and a fair price, check Google maps for dispensaries near you. Also, basically any street vendor who sells cigarettes and rolling papers is guaranteed to sell ganja too - you can shop around for your preferred balance of price and quality.

>What are good coffee, rum, and chocolate tours?

**SOME ADDITIONAL FAQs ANSWERED BY** u/YCSWife1 **and** u/Physical-Lifeguard-2

*Q: Should I rent a car while traveling in Jamaica? What will I need to bring? What should I expect?*

A: Your domestic driver's license is usually fine (as long as it is printed in English), registration, and insurance. You may or may not need your passport. Driving is on the left hand side of the road, drivers are slightly more aggressive, and the road in some places leaves much to be desired. If this would not be a problem for you, you should be fine. If you're planning on touring a large part of the island, this may be the solution for you.

*Q: How long can I stay in Jamaica while visiting?*

A: 90 days is the longest that you can stay in Jamaica on a tourist visa. Any longer would require a different type of visa.

*Q: Is it better to pay in US dollars or Jamaican dollars? Can I use credit cards/ATMs?*

A: Most businesses will accept dollars however you may get a better deal paying in the local currency. There are ATM's where you can get money in either US or Jamaican dollars. However, I would look really hard at the fees before using an ATM.

*Q: Does everyone smoke weed/have dreads/love reggae music? Do Jamaican men/women like\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?*

A: We are not a monolithic culture. The only thing that I know all Jamaicans dislike is the taste of cerasee.

Safety: Safety is relative to the area you’re are visiting. As much as Jamaica tends to have SOE’s and lower ranking travel advisories it is not a reflection of a majority of the country, which is relatively safe. On the topic of SOE’s it is important to understand that the level of seriousness of how we handle or conduct them does not live up to the name of a State of Emergency. You don’t have to worry about your activities/yours being cancelled or not being able to explore whoever you want. It is only specific to small areas and aimed at suspicious activity and checkpoints. Jamaicans go about their day as if it doesn’t exist and they are frequent at times so everyone is used to them. For eg. Canada has a level 3 or 4 Travel Advisory right now for Jamaica but yet their Prime Minister was announced to take a family vacation here after Christmas for a week. In terms of Montego Bay our crime/violence is usually community-based and tourists are not targeted specifically. Regular travel precautions are fine in Jamaica. Also because you are a tourist you’ll find that things are more expensive . You might be able to negotiate but not always and if you don’t want to buy anything after being constantly asked which is sadly common sometimes just say no thank you firmly and try to walk away.

In terms of transportation I recommend booking a driver who is also a guide tour driver (They can take you to hidden gems, let you experience food that is not like resorts/hotels and give you more uncommon information about certain spots). There are plenty of guide operators that are reputable you can find on instagram I’ll recommend a few: Tek a trip tours, ubertour jamaica and vip getaway tours. If you are going for a activity packed vacation - Ocho Rios is the best place, If you want a quiet, chill and relaxing vacation - Portland or Negril is best, and if you want to be in the centre of the everything and have the most convenience I’d say Montego Bay is best, lastly if you want a cultural trip Kingston is best in my opinion but you can find everyday life culture everywhere .

Jamaica was one of the most culturally rich and beautiful places I’ve ever been. Seriously, I had so many good conversations with workers at the resort we stayed at and even though I’m aware being on a resort I didn’t see all of Jamaica I still can’t shake this sadness of being gone. My fiancé and I would sit down with our resort staff and buy them a cigar so we could pick their brain about their daily life and everyday culture. I got WhatsApp to stay in contact with a couple female resort staff that were around my age, like a pen pal. But being in the states after listening and learning just makes me depressed. I wish to be back so bad talking to them.

 The hotels are making it a priority to clean up paths to the hotels first as tourism is a big industry.Call where your staying to find out.

Tourist wants to get to know the real Jamaica,"Hello everyone,

I will be spending my 30th birthday with my family in Jamaica in April.

I also feel that such hotels are disrespectful to the people who live there. But that's the way it is and I still want to try to get to know the country, the people, the culture, art, history, etc.. To get to know the real Jamaica and not the ""embellished"" tourist side. 

What can you recommend? What should I do? I would also like to go to Kingston, what do you think? I am really grateful for any tips.

I was wrong about Jamaica,"I’m new to Jamaica. I was so excited when I got an offer for a job here. And everything is okay except for the people who’s always trying to scam you and trying to milk you as much as they can. It’s not my first time in the Caribbean. I’ve been to different islands. I lived a couple of years in Trinidad, St. Lucia, Bahamas and Jamaica is my 4th Caribbean country. This is the first time I didn’t feel genuine Caribbean love and hospitality. It’s so rare and most times, the love they give you must be paid with money, food, etc. I don’t mind supporting local products and buying from street vendors. But it’s too much man. It happens everywhere and almost everyday. From taxi, to buying weed to almost everything. Everyone is trying to scam and hustle you out of money. I have to always have change to pay exact taxi fare or else they won’t give me my change. Been to a couple of arguments and even though I got back my money, it’s exhausting trying to argue everytime. It almost feels like, once you look different and talk different you must pay more or you shouldn’t take your change and tip everybody. I didn’t come here as a tourist. I’m here for work. And please don’t tell me to understand that Jamaica has a lot of struggling people and expect that. Jamaica isn’t the only Caribbean country that’s struggling and so far, this is the worst in terms of people’s honesty and integrity. Will definitely leave as soon as my contract is finished. Nature is nice tho but so is a lot of other islands. ",13,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamaicaTourism/comments/1cgnja7/i_was_wrong_about_jamaica/
Three spots for adventurous travelers in Negril*,"1. Red Dragon (right off Archer/Tank Hill rd) for your first trip to Red Dragon take a taxi. It’s a short taxi ride from the beach a little farther from the cliffs.

Why: pulled pork lunch, arguably the best pulled pork in Negril. I like to get there about 11:30 because when the pork is gone it’s gone for the day. It’s usually gone by 1:00 - 1:30.

When you get there tell them you’re there for the pork. They’ll make sure you get some. Bonus coldest beer in Negril.

This is a neighborhood bar but you’ll see a couple tourists there. Like all of Negril, respectful tourists are looked out for.

2. Mi Yard (west end rd)
Why: chill place out of the way but easy to get to, great for afternoon beers. If you’re there in late afternoon you may catch the peanut man pushing his cart up west end road (listen for his whistle).

This is spot where sit on the front porch with cold one and watch the world go by.
Also a great place to meet a local dog or two if you’re missing your pooch. I usually buy some dog food in Negril and keep it in my backpack for when I meet local dogs.

3. Connie’s Backyard Blessings (Tigress lane)
Why: Only country western bar in Negril and her red velvet cake may be the best thing you run into in Negril (and Connie is sweeter than bear meat).

Connie’s is an easy walk from Mi Yard but the first time you go there take a taxi because it is tricky to locate. The “One Love Pub Crawl” bus often stops at Connie’s and is a great way to find off the beaten path bars.

* none of these places are scary but none are real touristy either. I’m only sharing these places because they don’t get much notoriety and they will cement your love for Negril.",10,2,https://i.redd.it/4olty5vzf9be1.jpeg

Recommendations for avoiding bug bites in Negril,"We're heading to Negril in about 2.5 weeks and I'm trying to get ready. We were in Negril a year ago on a relatively busy vacation, so we didn't have a beach-only day until a day or two before we left. That day I got insanely bit up all over and whatever got me was very itchy, worse than mosquito bites. It took almost 2 weeks for it all to heal and go away. We absolutely loved our time in Negril and these bugs won't keep me away, but if possible I'd like to avoid this part of the experience on our return trip.

Just ate at Ivan’s in Negril,"100% the best food I’ve had in Jamaica. I had the penne jerk pasta and my wife had the chicken curry. It was nothing short of phenomenal.

Round Jamaica tour,"TLDR at end.

My wife and I have been going to Negril for 30-some years.   We've done a few ventures, like YS and Mayfield Falls, and had some experience with both the West End and the beach, but that was pretty much it.  

Being a track-and-field fan, I've always wanted to see the National High School Champs in Kingston in late March.  So, this year, with a combination of favorable factors, we did an around-the-island tour centered in the Champs in Kingston. 

We first went to Negril, and stayed in our favorite hotel, Charela.   In summary, we decided that this is the best place for us, and the around-the-island tour cemented this notion, but still some interesting experiences.   

After a week in Charela, we went to Treasure Beach, and stayed at the 'standard' of Jakes, in a cabin.  Of all the places we stayed outside of Negril, this was probably the best experience.   

One impression was that Treasure Beach can be quite dry, with cacti around, while the NE end of the Island, Port Antonio, is quite lush. 

After Treasure Beach, we went into the Blue Mountains (I have another post on that) - in hindsight, I should have brought some trekking poles, but we had a nice full day there.   It's quite an experience.

The Champs in Kingston did not disappoint, but I'm a track fan.   The competition is amazing, although the meet is dominated with a few teams:  Kingston College, Jamaica College, St. Jago, and Calabar on the boys side, and Edwin Allen and Hydel on the girls side.   It was great to be among some major track fans who know all the local teams. 

We then drove to Port Antonio.   This ended up with something of an unfortunate surprise.  The place we stayed at, Mockingbird Hill, is on the market.   It's a 'green' hotel, and I got the impression that in its heyday, it was quite pleasant, but the owners weren't there and the caretaker was odd, to say the least.   There's no air conditioning or refrigerators.   To keep stuff cool, we had to drive to a market to get ice for the ice-chest.    The restaurant is now being run independently by a cook, who is quite good, but is having to make do with a lack of amenities.  He has a sense of humor when we asked him about why he's cooking there.   He said ""I made a big mistake"".    The oddness aside, we walked along the beach at Long Bay, and hung out at Frenchman's Cove (a well tended beach, with a bar and kitchen that serves up food, admission fee).   

We then went to Jewel Paradise Cove, an all-inclusive (our first) in Runaway Bay - near Ochos Rios.   It was good enough, but we decided that all inclusives were not for us.  

Places I'd return:  Blue Mountains to hike the peak, Kingston for another Chaps, Treasure Beach for a couple of days.   Places I'd cross off:  Port Antonio, and anything in the Ochos Rios area (too crowded and built up).

Other items:  the road along the coast from Kingston to Port Antonio along the coast is supposedly horrible, so we drove across the hills to get to Port Antonio.

TLDR

Driving:  We rented a car, but had a driver take us.  I would \*not\* want to drive in Jamaica.  There is an art to passing, avoiding pot-holes and the general rhythm that I wouldn't get.   No mishaps, so that was good. 

Getting around:  We had absolutely no problems anywhere - not sure what the travel warnings are for.  Just stay in places that seem normal, don't stray into sketchy areas at night, but this would apply to almost any place around the globe.

Local culture: difficult to get if you're on the tourist end of things.  I'd say the one 'true' cultural item was the high school championships.    If you're into track and field, I highly recommend building this into your plans.   My only complaint about Kingston is that the rush hour traffic on a Friday afternoon is horrible, so plan accordingly.   We found a great driver to take us around Kingston, and another to take us from Mavis Bank up into the Blue Mountains.

Budget Questions Travelling to Negril," Hello all! Thanks in advance for reading and any advice.

I'm travelling to Negril for 2 weeks at start of April. We booked a non-inclusive hotel and had some questions. I have been looking at prices of activities and restaurants and it is looking a lot more expensive than I was hoping. We aren't looking for a fancy holiday, most days probably eating food bought from supermarkets and explore local areas on foot. However we would like do a few more activities.

1. If we avoided very touristic places how much are we likely to spend on a meal out?
2. Where would you recommend booking excursions/activities? Should we book online or wait until we are in person and book from hotel/businesses?
3. What are the top things you would recommend to do from Negril.",9,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamaicaTourism/comments/1biwcfd/budget_questions_travelling_to_negril/

Looking for a nice cannabis friendly resort,"Hi. I am looking for a nice resort or boutique hotel where me and my lady can chill on our balcony, smoke and relax without worry that we are going to run into issues with the staff or other guests. Most of the info I have found is along the lines of ""you should be fine. I saw people smoking all week."" When I hear this, it still seems like acceptance is questionable. I can picture some bridezilla at a Sandals bitching to management that we are ruining her honeymoon because we are smoking on our balcony. We come from a legal state, so being able to smoke is very important. We don't drink a lot.

We do want modern room amenities, a nice pool, room service and on site dining. Beach is less important but we do want an ocean front room. If it is on a cliff, access to a beach club would be good. All inclusive is preferred,  but not mandatory.

I am aware that Cannabis isn't legal from a recreational standpoint, but my understanding  is it is available everywhere, and some  dispensaries will give you a med card on site.

We really just want peace, a comfy room, a nice pool, beautiful views, good food, lots of weed, and each other. 

I've looked into Negril, and I've looked into Couples resorts, but I just can't really tell what the vibe truly is at those places. The other properties have been suggested seem to be lacking in one or more areas such as room quality, ocean views, or access to dining.

Jewel grande,"
We just returned from an incredible and relaxing vacation at Jewel Grande Montego Bay, and I have to say—the food was outstanding! I’ve never had better food at a resort before.

A huge shoutout to Toby at Waves, who went above and beyond for us. He even ordered pizza in advance for our children, knowing they loved it—such a thoughtful touch!

We also had a butler service, and I can’t say enough about Aston and Denton. They were amazing—making dinner reservations for us every night and even bringing us food on the beach!

The overall atmosphere was peaceful and relaxing, with no blaring music all the time, which we really appreciated. Each night featured a show, which, while not extraordinary, was still entertaining and gave us something to do. That said, MC Whitney was fantastic—she knew exactly how to engage and energize the crowd!

All in all, it was a great experience, and I would definitely return. Of course, no hotel is perfect, and there were some minor blips, but nothing significant enough to take away from our trip. Looking forward to visiting again!

Montego Bay or Negril?,"I’m going to jamaica with my boyfriend and we are both planning on a trip to Jamaica in May. We are a bit undecided on whether or not to stay in Montego Bay or Negril. Montego Bay seems the most convenient due to the proximity of the airport, but i’ve been looking at videos and the beach at Negril seems more beautiful.  I’m also a bit concerned about the rainy season and potential seaweed. 


I was also thinking about staying 4 nights in Negril and staying my last night in Montego Bay just to avoid the stress being on my last day. 

We do want to stay on the best beach in Jamaica and it seems that Negril Seven mile beach is that option. We are both in our 20s but not really looking to party just to relax and chill, maybe do one or two excursions if that. 

Does anyone have any all-inclusive hotel recommendations in either Montego Bag or Negril or any excursion companies they had success with? 

Any private drivers that can be recommended to drive me from Negril to Montego Bay?

Blue Mountains,"&#x200B;

I just got into Kingston from the Blue Mountains.   Here are some impressions. TLDR at end

There is a relatively fancy hotel called Strawberry Hill, which is up in the hills, but not particularly close to Blue Mountain itself.   Strawberry Hill is quite expensive.

We wanted to get closer.   There is a road that winds up from the Papine neighborhood of Kingston.   The road is quite curvy/bumpy up until Mavis Bank, but you can make it with great care.  Personally, I went with a driver with experience and a relatively high wheel base.    The main jumping off point to the Blue Mountains is a town called Mavis Bank.   From Mavis Bank onward, you definitely want a local driver and a car that can take the road, which is almost exclusively a dirt track with lots of bumps and ups-and -downs and steep curves.    You can park next to the Mavis Bank Police Station.  

From Mavis bank, lower down, there is not so much in the way of houses, but as you get up higher, there is more population.   Most people get around on Land Rovers, pick-ups, and dirt bikes.   The density of population is associated with the proximity to farms, mainly coffee. 

My wife and I had some thought to giving a try of hiking Blue Mountain peak, but when I saw it , I realized we didn't have enough conditioning.   You'd want to have a fair amount of conditioning for a 11 mile hike - 4 +4 hours out and back.    I'd recommend boots and trekking poles.   

We stayed at Jays Guest House, which was about halfway from Mavis Bank to the trailhead.   It took about an hour to get there from Mavis Bank.  It has a magnificent view of Blue Mountain itself.   People often will take off at 2 AM with a one-hour drive to the trailhead, followed by a 3 AM hike.  

You would definitely want a guide!   I'm guessing they charge about 100 USD, and there is an entrance fee.  I forget the exact amount, but probably of order 30 USD.    The rationale for such an early start is to hike without clouds on the way down.   The tops of the mountains get enveloped in clouds around 9-10 AM.    If you start off around 10 AM, you aren't going to get much of a view, except of the clouds.

We decided against an attempt at the peak because of the lack of conditioning for an 11 mile hike with a lot of ups-and-downs.     Also, I wasn't mentally ready for a 2 AM start.  

We hung out mostly at Jays Guest House, just marveling at the unique local culture of the folks who live along the dirt road.   We did hire a guide to take up on a hike to a local farm, which was mostly for coffee, but also has grapefruit, plantain, and bananas.    I wouldn't necessarily call the area a rain forest, but it was quite verdant and pleasant.    

The populated stretch of road has a lot of people giving friends rides on motor-bikes and pickups.   There is a lot of self reliance, as you might imagine for an area like that.   

TLDR:  the Blue Mountain coffee growing region has a unique culture along the main dirt road that runs up into the hills.   It's worth a day's visit.   If you have the notion of hiking Blue Mtn. peak itself, be well conditioned, have trekking poles, good boots, and be ready for a 3 AM start.    From Mavis Bank onward, have a local drive with a vehicle that can make it.    ",9,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamaicaTourism/comments/1bkjrki/blue_mountains/

One Love Bus Pub Crawl,"One Love Bus Bar Crawl



Pic: We were the first ones on the bus. 

This is bar-none the best activity we’ve done in four or five trips to Negril.
Lembert picked us up first in the west end then we drove all the way out to the A-I’s at the opposite end of Negril. We picked up a bunch, then back toward town picking up people from traditional resorts as we headed to the west end.

It was great mixer, we met fun people and people who seemed not to even know there is a third world.

We went to a mix of bars: half swanky/ half dives. Many we’d been to before and a couple were new to us.

At the end of the night we were about a half mile from our resort (“Catcha”) and since we knew Lembert had to take all the A-I folks back at the far end of town, we told him we’d walk back. He said he’d take us back first since he picked us up first. What a great gesture on his part.

If you’re even contemplating it - just do it. We hemmed and hawed on a couple trips and regret not doing it sooner. Next April we’re going on the crawl twice - it’s that much fun!",7,2,https://i.redd.it/6hooyzke17ec1.jpeg

4. Hideaway at Royalton Negril
5. Royalton Blue Waters 

I see GPLH is on the excellent master spreadsheet, but the others are not so I don’t know how they compare.  I was set on booking this one, then saw some negative reviews that made me nervous!

We are a couple in our late 20s, ideally looking for somewhere with a lovely beach area, pool area, spacious rooms with a nice bath, and a variety of included a la carte restaurants (I am not expecting the food to be world class, but a variety keeps it fresh!).  We don’t need it to be ‘party party party’ but some entertainment would be nice, and access to water activities would be a massive plus.  We’d also like to do an excursion or two. 

We stayed in the Ocean Riveria Paradise in Mexico last year and loved it. My only real criticism was that quite a lot was ‘Privilege’ only - two of the restaurants and two of the pools were out of bounds to us. I see from the reviews that GPLH have recently introduced a similar thing.

Best area to get an AirBnb in Negril?,"Hello all,

First time to Jamaica. We picked it over Cancun since Negril seems to still have a not-too-commercialized feel as opposed to Cancun. And everyone says the white sand beaches were beautiful in Negril. There will be myself, my wife, and our 3 kids 18-23 year old. Given our number I think an AirBnb makes more sense. Which area should we look for.

We will likely be on resort for most of the trip just enjoying the beach and pools. Probably an excursion or two.

Jamaica Retreat in Treasure Beach,"We have a large five/seven bedroom villa at our main Lashings resort in Sandy Bank, with stunning views of the coast.

Ital/ Vegan food and Shroomiez,"**Q1-** New Orleans based visiting JA next week. Anywhere near MoBay, or between MoBay and Coral Springs that you recommend for vegan/ Ital food and/ or reputable mushroom dispensary for grief therapeutic purposes? Close friend from JA passed away last year and coming to pay respect to his family that live outside of Sheffield. Sadly, family visiting JA from CA insist on staying at all inclusive near Coral Spring. Trying to find balance....

**Q2** Want to support local economy as much as possible, and thought about passing out flyers to tourists about the Jamaican Beach Birthright Environmental Movement. Would that be disrespectful? As a New Orlinean we definitely understand the tourist/ local love balance. In N.O. we LOVE our locals and visitors. I have often heard that those from JA are treated with less respect from resort staff etc. Any advice is appreciated on how to show love to locals, respectfully.  Want to make sure I am acting right, yaherme?

**Q3 - What can I bring that is needed? Have Claritin, Tylenol, toothbrushes, lots of school supplies, workbooks etc. Any suggestions on what to bring or who needs it most would be so respectfully appreciated!**

Help coordinating a trip to Rick's Cafe from the Royaltin in Negril,"Sorry, another post by me.
    
There are 4 adults and 2 kids in our group staying at the Royaltin in Negril. We want to check out Rick's Cafe (we've heard 2pm might be the best time in terms of getting a table). Whats the best way to get there and back?

From my understanding, the resort can get us a taxi to get down there, but if we stay for some drinks and cliff jump watching - how is the best way to get a taxi back to the resort?

Seeking club/ nightlife dancing recommendations,"My bf and I are going to be in Jamaica the first week of February for possible one or two weeks. We’ve left it open-ended so that we can flow, possible country hop if we want or prolong stay if we like. 
We both love dancehall, afrobeats, and soca. (I’d say in that order lol)
So we are now starting to plan where we will stay and when. I want to base it on some good parties, events, clubs, etc. 
we are also open to other recommendations. We love the ocean , waterfalls, hikes, etc. 
we want the best of both worlds. Maybe a couple days in an all inclusive, a couple days in a jungle vibe, and def a couple days in the dancehall scene. 
I am not scared in any way, but you know people in the US are always regurgitating the ole jamaica is so dangerous trope. So to appease my bf (who is from st lucia ) I figured I’d post in a forum and see the recommendations of locals as to remain “safe” as some of his now Jamaican friends who are US side have been convincing him not to go to Kingston and i this that’s lame. 
I only want to go to Jamaica for the culture, otherwise we’d hit up any other island. 

So lay it on us. What’s good!? Where should we go? What days are the best for dancing? Any day parties? Festivals? Best waterfall? Best hotels? Best food? (We like Caribbean food)

Our fav artists that if somehow we could manifest seeing, it’d make our trip!
-chronixx
-buju banton
-spice
-valiant
-Tommy Lee 
-shenseaa 
-koffee 
-Kranium 

Now we’ve seen most of these artists already but I figure just giving y’all an idea of what we are into can maybe direct us in the right direction and if someone happens to know of some parties where they are playing…. Well even better :)

My 80+ father and I will be visiting Jamaica from Australia for 7 days in July. This is to help Dad fulfill a lifelong dream of watching a test in the Caribbean.

We are just trying to work out logistics of where we stay. We are not particularly interested in staying in resorts. For us just getting a bit of a vibe for Jamaican food and culture would be great.

Would we be better off staying in Kingston? Or are there any areas outside of Kingston that would still be close enough to get to Sabina Park? If we stay in Kingston are Airbnb's doable/safe so we aren't on top of each other for a week as we might be in a hotel room? Or is a hotel a better bet?

Jamwest Adventures in Negril,"First of all, this excursion was very misrepresented. Our Amstar representative said that the venue was “a little over an hours drive.  Well when we arrived 2.5 hours later we already had a bad taste in our mouths. Upon arrival we noticed that there was no other visitors. We were directed to the reception area to sign waivers (they had ours incorrect but did fix it). We were informed that we would require “water shoes” and that they would have plenty at the attraction. Yes they do but for $16 a pair. Also told about other items to bring, which we did, only to be told that everything would need to be locked up… that’s a $7 charge to rent a locker! After signing the waivers we were informed that we needed to place our lunch orders in advance. We ordered pepperoni pizza, $20. Finally the four of us were shuttled to the zip line area. I must state that we ❤️ Jamaica 🇯🇲 for the friendly people but the employees here seem very unhappy and it’s apparent.  I was unsure how we would be received by our zip line instructors but they loosened up and it was a very enjoyable activity. They take pictures of you during activities but we were not interested in purchasing them. Next we did the ATV rides. This is a 7.5 mile track cut out in a jungle with some water 💦 that you can ride through. The trail takes you over to the ocean briefly which was nice. It’s a shame there wasn’t a bar on the beach with ample time to swim. We had lunch when we returned, not too bad. We are just used to excursions which provide lunch and drinks. It seems that other than horseback riding, the park is directed towards children (swimming area and kid rides). I’m scoring this low due the 5 hours of travel for the day as well as the lack of friendly employees. We requested an earlier ride back to our resort and were told that it would be at least 1.5 hours until we could get a ride. Felt trapped there.

Blue mountain peak hike,"Hi all I’m visiting Jamaica next week fly into Kingston Monday. Would love to hike to peak of the blue mountain - I do have a rental car and just need some guidance on best and most economical options to get to the trail head. Open to any recommendations also would love to hear about good and safe options to stay around the blue mountains as well.

The rental car is not a 4x4 so I understand that I might only be able to drive past Mavis Bank? 

So my questions are

what is the cost for a local to give a ride to the trail head ?

Is a guide absolutely necessary for the hike to the peak ? 

And is the a local place where folks post that we can join a larger group to plan a hike to the peak ? 

Approximate cost that I can expect so that I can be aware of what is a fair price ?

Appreciate any suggestions ! Cheers

Visiting Jamaica for a H1b visa appointment,"So I am an Indian living in the US. US visa slots are not available in India. 

So I started looking for countries around US. Bahamas and Jamaica both allow Indian citizens who have US visa.

Bahamas seem more expensive. And Jamaica feels more interesting :) Mostly because of the whole reggae music connection. I feel I will enjoy a 2 week vacation in Jamaica more than Bahamas. Also Jamaica I think is cheaper than Bahamas.

However the two concerns I have are:  
1. Safety. I am from India and I know how third world countries are. If you are a brown/black person visiting India, I would directly tell you not to visit you won't have a pleasant experience. If you are a white person I will tell you that you will be treated well, but people will try to scam you everywhere you go. So just directly tell me if you think it is safe for Indians.

2. Vegetarian food. I need vegetarian food to survive. Can I find cheap vegetarian food in Kingston?",3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamaicaTourism/comments/1eq80i0/visiting_jamaica_for_a_h1b_visa_appointment/

"Kingston to Runaway Bay - Bus, Rental Car or Private Transfer?","
Hey everyone 

My flight lands in Kingston, but I’m meeting up with friends at a resort in Runaway Bay, Jewel Paradise Cove to be exact. 

My question is: how do I get from Kingston airport to the resort? 

I saw that there’s the bus service, Knutsford Express. Would I need to taxi to the Kingston stop, then when I arrive at the Montego Bay Airport, take a shuttle or another taxi to the resort? 

I was also looking at renting a car from Kingston Airport to Montego Bay Airport, but I’m seeing a lot of one-way fees applied by the different agencies and then there is also a lot of whispers in my ear about it not being safe for tourists to drive on their own. I’d appreciate some honest feedback about whether you’d recommend me to drive, or is it better to leave that idea behind? 

I saw on Viator that there’s private taxi transfers. I was considering that option until I saw the cost being almost triple the price of a rental car for the day, and about six times the cost of the bus service for two people. The average cost seemed to be over $350 USD for the private transfer. Is this what is the usual rate? If not, can any one recommend a taxi service that isn’t so steep? 

In my cost/benefit analysis, renting a car seems to be the most convenient and cheapest option. However, it seems to also be the least safe option? 

I’d really appreciate any suggestions/feedback on what you all think I should do. 

Thanks in advance. ",3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamaicaTourism/comments/1bu4ndq/kingston_to_runaway_bay_bus_rental_car_or_private/

We do have a couple of questions, that we were hoping you all could help us with. (all currencies listed as USD)

"AVOID FIREMAN'S LOBSTER PIT IN NEGRIL! - Phone, ID, and Credit Card Stolen","I had a frustrating experience in Negril, and am sort of going scorched earth about it, but we were robbed and then dealt with really evasive and insulting management at Fireman's Lobster Pit in Negril. here's a copy of the review we put out on trip advisor, but I would steer clear of that spot. there's a ton of other amazing lobster opportunities, all over Negril. 

&#x200B;

My Fiancee and I had a terrible experience were robbed by an employee or an employee's acquaintance at Fireman's Lobster Pit, and management covered it up. our phone, ID Card, and Credit Card were stolen at the restaurant and we were reassured by management that the multiple cameras on the property would indicate who was responsible. the owner of the restaurant mentioned that the only person to have access to the cameras lived in Canada (?), but was diligent in sharing their contact information. we knew the time stamp of the footage, and which camera would have revealed who the thief was, but management constantly sent us footage other than what we were asking for, completely avoiding the camera and the time stamp we were asking for. at a certain point, the management began sending us evasive messages and never came forward with what we were hoping to find. we ultimately contacted the police.  


I hate that we feel obliged to send this review. there were certainly members of staff who were sympathetic, kind, and frustrated that we were robbed, and management was initially very friendly and cooperative. but a few bad eggs spoiled our whole experience.

We rented a car,"

We are staying in Mo'bay early March and decided to rent a car and I'm wondering if it was a good idea.  We just want to be able to get around as wanted and not pay $100pp to get across the island if we feel like going.  We're used to traveling as well as vacationing but this is our first time coming to Jamaica. I would LOVE some advice especially on the following 

1. Fish and produce.... supermarket or are there fruit stands and fresh  fish for sale  down by the water?  We prefer to support local farmers and fisherman if possible.  

2. We can drive on the left and are used to aggressive drivers. We don't plan to go out late at night except one trip to the bio luminescent pools. Should we take a taxi for this one as it's after dark? 

3. Anything off the beaten path someone can recommend? We're looking to avoid tourist traps (minus the pools and I definitely want a river tour, don't care which river. Would love a recommendation! )

4. I have MS and need actual medical grade cannabis,  is this actually possible and are the dispensaries the right way to go vs local ? Is it rude to explain what I'm looking for and why? 

5. Can we go outside the tourist areas safely to eat/shop? Any areas to actually avoid?  ( if visiting NJ, USA , I would tell you 100% NO CAMDEN and NO PATERSON AT ALL, EVER!!!!) . As we are driving ourselves around for the most part, so this is super important.  
Does it matter if he's European? ( unfortunately it does on some islands in certain areas). We need to shop as we're in a rental and will be cooking for ourselves. As mentioned,  we have the car.

Car Hire / Island travel questions,"My (new!) wife and I are heading to Jamaica on our honeymoon this spring.  


We have just over 2 weeks travelling round the island on a bit of road trip to experience as many places as possible. We are staying 2-3 nights in each place maximum so will be in need of transport.  


I've read the threads with people saying driving is tough and others saying it's ok, I've driven round Cuba, through the mountains and jungle in the centre of the island which will certainly be worse than anything Jamaica's roads have to offer.  


Nevertheless, finding car hire is proving expensive! We have one part of the trip rolling through the blue mountains so think we will probably need 4WD. But the prices are nuts, almost $1800 USD. With many asking more for insurance (such a scam!)  


What do people recommend as options? We really like having the freedom of a car, but would we be better just saving that cash and using drivers for the 2 weeks?  


Really appreciate peoples help",4,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamaicaTourism/comments/195x1f0/car_hire_island_travel_questions/

"Vacation soon, SOS pls :)","Hi everyone,

  
I will be traveling with my best friend to Jamaica early May. We are animal and nature lovers, in our mid 20's and female. I recently visited Jamaica and stayed @ RIU Montego Bay. (I did not have the best time, mostly due to my company, but I couldn't care less for the cookie cutter bare, minimum resort). I spent most of my time in Negril and am leaning towards staying there this time. I would prefer an AI, adults only resort. I'm interested in going to 7 mile beach, one love bus pub crawl, Ricks cafe, Blue Hole springs, snorkeling, and more. We live in Florida so the beach is ""normal"" to us therefore I am excited about the cliffs. 

I have been looking into Sunset at the Palms. My only concern is we are in our mid-20's and I'm not sure of the age demographic that SATP attracts and the entertainment it provides. Overall, this vacation is to relax and recharge. While I'd much rather get an authentic feel of Jamaica, I want to make sure there are opportunities for us to socialize and fit in. 

Additional needs/interests: transportation to/from airport, transportation to/from excursions (maybe a tour guide), horseback riding, zip-lining, cooking class, tubing, and experiencing/seeing the true Jamaican culture. 

Going down the rabbit hole/extra questions and thoughts:  Should we wait until we get to Jamaica to book and pay for the excursion or set them up in advance? We also thought about a hotel (non AI) or an airbnb (major concerns of lack of socialization but there is more space). I also think Xtabi looks cool. I understand its not adult only nor AI but maybe it is worth it?  

Any recommendations and tips will be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance . :) ",3,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamaicaTourism/comments/1j1qm3u/vacation_soon_sos_pls/

I saw some lionfish on the dives in Mobay yesterday and was wondering if there are any restaurants that have lionfish on the menu because I have been told that they taste pretty good.

UPDATE:
As I have been scuba diving in Mobay and while diving we saw several lionfish and our instructor also spearfished some of them, I asked him for advice.
He told me that at least in Mobay most restaurants now have lionfish on the menu of course depending on the fishing success of that day. He specifically mentioned Pier One and said that this would be an item you would not find on the menu but rather had to ask for or maybe even order/confirm on the phone in advance.",3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamaicaTourism/comments/1hgk297/lionfish_in_mobay/

One-way to Jamaica,"I know there's other subs for Jamaica from a tourist perspective but this is the 'JAMAICA' sub I frequent regularly. If mods prefer this question to be out of bounds I understand and won't be upset if removed. 🙏🏽

Question preamble, I've been traveling into Jamaica (Kingston and Mobay) since 1990 and after I purchased my first property I dropped out of the lame all-inclusive (pretend) experience and now have loads of connections and of course many yaardie connections I interact with regularly. 

I only booked one-way flights for the past few years without any issues leaving Canada or entering Jamaica without a return ticket. My wife bounced out a couple weeks ago and just flew back in with all sorts of challenges without a return ticket and ultimately had to book a return flight before they'd let her check-in for departure. 

It's not a huge problem but wondering if anyone has some insight into so called (nonsense) 'rules' about having a return flight?

P.S. I get the obvious regarding 3 month max for Canada passports but the return flight ticket does nothing to enforce this limit as I've skipped a return flight many times so the rule is useless inconvenience IMHO. We either extend our visa with Babylon or just bounce for a couple weeks when we come close to going over the 'approved' limit.",3,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamaicaTourism/comments/1h74is8/oneway_to_jamaica/

Seeking Advice: Kingston Stay vs. All-Inclusive Resort for a Weekend Trip?,"Hi everyone,

We've booked our tickets to Kingston for next month (11th-14th) and would love your input on the following options:

1. We're interested in exploring Kingston but aren't sure how safe it is. Since it's a weekend trip, we're leaning toward staying at a nice property (like the AC Hotel, ROK, etc.), spending a day or two in Kingston, and possibly taking a day trip. Do you think Kingston is safe and worth it for a young couple?
2. Alternatively, we could head to one of the all-inclusive resorts. This seems like the safest and most convenient option, but I’m unsure how different it would be from similar resorts in other Caribbean countries. Also, I noticed that the last bus to the northwest (a more affordable option) leaves at 7pm, and we arrive just after that.

Which option would you recommend, or is there a better third choice?

Understanding the vibe of the island,"
Greetings,
Curious to understand the differences between parts of the island as it will be my firstntime travelling to your country. We are a young family, adventurous and not lazy but also in need of repose. It is hard for me to go for the all-inclusive result type of vacation though maybr I am wrong, as it feels fake and almost wrong (bigger discussion as to why, for another time). We usually travel to big cities with our toddler under 2 years old, take her to museums, three course meal restaurants, tapas bars, public transport etc. this trip I want her to see more nature, so why not Jamaica? I know she will love the people :) 

So! What would be good for that age group? Jumping off cliffs in Negril looks beautiful but inaccessible at this age. Same for rope jumping into bodies of water. But, the beach in Negril is white sand and easier for toddlers? We will all need water shoes to protect us from the reefs in Ocho Rios? I heard the beach in Ocho is shallow and good for kids. We can go bamboo rafting anywherr. Would the blue mountains be a good place to split our week in Jamaica or pick one spot and stay put? Is Montego bay a port that cruise ships spew tourists into? Or is it not as touristy as Ocho? Is Kingston worth flying into? Many many questions! Would love to hear what the locals think!  So far I have seen a beautiful simple hotel in Ocho & leaning towards that but want to know what the vibe there will be. Flying in the beginning of December btw.

Thank you!",3,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamaicaTourism/comments/1fax4gk/understanding_the_vibe_of_the_island/

Possible trip in October!,"Hi there!

I've never been to Jamaica, and recently had someone inquire about some work there in October. I work in video.

I'm contemplating the trip, and would like to take my family (wife and child).

They'd pay for everything for me. Flights, shuttle, and resort. They said we would fly into Montego Bay, and shuttle to Ochos Rios. The resort they are staying at is called Beaches.

I looked it up, and it seems that October is towards the tail end of hurricane season. Also, that it rains a small bit during the day but clear most of it.

From photos, the beach itself looks somewhat small where the resort is located, but it's really beautiful.

I imagine it would be safe, and leave my wife/child in the resort while I'm out working during the couple of days?

**I'm not familiar with Ochos Rios, or all inclusives at all, and just wanted to get some insight from locals or those who have traveled.**

Despite the distance, I've made it a tradition to travel back to Jamaica every year for the past decade, spending at least one month there each time. My longest stay was for three months.

During my visits, I've always found comfort in being around my partner, who I've known since my very first trip to Jamaica. However, one thing I've struggled with is expanding my social circle and meeting new people who share similar interests.

This year, I'll be in Jamaica for an extended six-month period, and I'm eager to build a vibrant social life beyond my partner and his friends, with whom I don't have much in common. While I appreciate their company, I'm hoping to connect with like-minded souls who enjoy activities such as working out, going for walks, or even a run. You'll often find me at Emancipation Park, embracing the outdoors and staying active.

I'm also excited to explore all that Jamaica has to offer, whether it's dining out, sightseeing, or even hitting up the club scene.

We wanted to visit Cup Cone and Stick and also Wake and Bake Cafe to buy edibles and flower. Do they also sell papers, grinders, or pipes? Also, we have never used a steam chalice, is there a possibility of being able to smoke this way anywhere in Negril without having to take a cannabis tour? Are there any other cannabis shops we should visit?

Has anyone smoked cannabis on the Zimbali Rasta lunch hike? Is that allowed?

2) My company will refund some of my expenses if I put their VAT number in the receipt ( I believe yours equivalent is called GCT), is it easy to do this?

5) Finally, should I buy a sim card? I believe I'll have wifi at the airbnb and at work.

1st visit coming up to celebrate my 40th with close friends. All are adults (about 6 of us). We are booked at Excellence All Inclusive in Oyster Bay (not sure if its great but I went by Google reviews).

1) We plan on doing the river tubing and Dunns Falls as a must . Not sure how far these are from Oyster Bay....do we hire a driver or pay for a package with pickup/dropoff to resort? Any recs on sites to use for these? The river raft also sounds appealing but not sure if it gets boring just sitting on the raft..lol. 

2) I know weather is hard to predict for a tropical island but what it is like in end of Sep? As long as its not raining everyday, we are good.

3) For excursions, is it better to book locally when there OR use places like TripAdvisor etc (which has higher prices).

4) We are also rum drinkers and planning to do one visit to a brewery...any recs would be highly appreciated!

In 2 and half weeks, I will be traveling to Jamaica for the very first time. I am almost 30 and will go with 2 friends. We want to just relax, get in to the Jamaican culture, have some dancehall parties, ... Every accommodation is already booked. We are staying in B&B's and hostels. We don't want to all in resort kind of holiday.

Intenerary is the follow:

Mobay (1 night)  
Treasure beach (3 nights)  
Kingston (4 nights)  
Irish Town (2 nights)  
Port Antonio (5 nights)  
Kingston (3 nights)  
Treasure beach (3 nights)  
Mobay (1 night)

I have a few questions; since we are not from the US, we find it pretty expensive to hire a driver. We will not rent a car.

1. How are the route taxi's? I found a website (https://www.roadaffair.com/getting-around-jamaica-in-route-taxis/). Is it crazy to travel with a route taxi to and from our places? The island really looks small so I think it would not be a problem, but I have never been there.
2. Do you really need a local guide when visiting places? Can't we just go alone to places?
3. I don't fear for safety, but what are the main DO's and DONT's specific for Jamaica?
4. USD vs JMD; our hostels and accommodations prefer USD. Is it a good idea to just have USD for excursions and our accommodations and for the daily stuf (drinks, food, taxi, ...) use JMD?

Booking Excursions thru Royalton app or with Sunwing rep?,"I’m thinking of booking an excursion (dolphins), I’m staying at the Royalton resort in Jamaica. This hotel has an app, and it’s showing the excursion as cheaper 

The sunwing/nexus rep basically told me they could give me a discount but it ended up being a higher price compared to the app.

When I told them this, they basically said ya but we don’t get commission if u do that. Also gave me horror stories of sometimes the bus doesn’t show up if u book like that, etc. but it’s the hotel’s app? What do I do?

I’ve been looking at Ocho Rios, Negril, or Montego Bay. Which of the three would yall recommend? Preferably somewhere he can be out fishing all day and maybe somewhere great for snorkeling. I know he’s been to Montego Bay before but I can’t really ask him about it without ruining the surprise.

best resorts/places to stay at,"hi all! my friend and i (25F) are maybe planning to go to Jamaica for the first time sometime next month just for 4-5 days. we are looking for a place to stay (either a resort or hotel) and this is what we are trying to find:

* possibly somewhere to stay that is all inclusive, but open to non inclusive and visiting other restaurants if its walking distance from resort/hotel
* somewhere that does have a nightlife (either at hotel/resort, or at surrounding locations)
* great views, with beach and pool 
* somewhere with a balcony for potential smoking 

for reference, i have stayed at riu palace las americas in cancun - i enjoyed it and also liked that the strip was five min walking distance from our resort, but i felt like the resort itself looked a little outdated.

Was due to go away for a long time this winter but due to operations and stuff have had to postpone actually travelling but am able to go somewhere for around a month. I’m a diver so obviously would be amazing for that, plus a million other reasons I would want to visit but my main concern is safety. 

I’m 30, and would be on my own. Is it a situation where I would be advised to basically stay inside a resort etc or would I be fine in most places? When I do eventually go away for a while it’s all going to be South and East of the UK so would be a great chance to go there.",2,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamaicaTourism/comments/1fxcqo0/is_it_safe_as_a_solo_male/

I understand that some of the main concerns are theft, damage, and fraud, such as guests being scammed out of their money by individuals who fail to deliver the car.

To mitigate these risks, I have developed strategies to prevent and resolve these issues when they arise.

**For Hosts:**

* Car owners are encouraged to install a tracking device to help in the event of theft.
* They must verify their identity with an official ID and provide proof of ownership, including insurance, fitness, registration documents, and a police record.
* Interested hosts must sign up for our insurance provider at a discounted rate.
* Until verification is complete, hosts cannot list their cars.
* Hosts are not sent funds until the guest confirms they have received the exact car they requested.

**For Guests:**

* Drivers must verify their identity with a driver's license, a payment card, a profile photo, and proof of address if they are local.
* Guests can purchase damage protection for their trip for as low as US$20 per day.
* Our SnapSafe feature allows guests to capture and store images of the car upon check-in, which are stored on our platform and cannot be altered. This ensures fair damage settlements if needed.
* We offer escrow services to prevent fraud, holding funds until the guest confirms they are satisfied with their rental.

What other concerns can we address to make our platform safer & better for you?",2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamaicaTourism/comments/1djuz9h/i_am_building_a_jamaicabased_car_rental_aggregator/

Trusted taxi service recommendation ,"Had the most amazing trip with my partner  to Runaway Bay, Jamaica the last 2 weeks! Miss it already. 

We were so fortunate to meet Bolt, who taxied us to the sights and tours of the famous attractions. He is from the locql area so recommended places to visit and met trusted tour companies that were also locally owned (not the massive businesses that the hotels push on you).

He took us to the best, hidden and authentic places to eat and drink and was by our side keeping us safe aswell as on standby when I needed a quick dash to the convienience store, late at night. We tried doing the tours through the hotel and I'm telling you it's so much better having your own air conditioned car all to yourself. Honestly...the resort couldn't offer this level of service and trust me maaan, he's one hell of a good driver!

How's the driving in Jamaica? I'm from rural UK so alot of our roads are skinny and bendy ect and we drive on the left so should be a huge issue.

Whats some safe places to visit? I understand there's alot of gangster culture in Jamaica atm and obviously want to stay away from those places, but would really appreciate a look In some ""off the beaten track"" villages and towns to try local foods and drinks away from tourist areas.

We'll be travelling to Jamaica from Canada in a couple of weeks and I'm wondering what the best eSIM with Voice, SMS, and Data will be. Most eSIM providers seem to use data, but I will need the ability to receive an occasional voice or SMS call as well as data.

"Knutsford, route taxis, is my itinerary too ambitious?","Hello,

I am visiting in April with a well travelled friend but it's a first time in Jamaica for both of us.

We decided to skip renting a car and were thinking of mostly taking Knutsford Express, route taxis and shuttles to get around. 

I saw a lot of suggested itineraries but mostly they are for people with cars. We will be there for 15 days and I wanted to know if what I want to do is realistic if we don't want to just spend our days on the bus or waiting at taxis stops.

Here goes:

Landing in MoBay, 2 nights in MoBay.

* Negril
* Treasure Beach
* Kingston (can be only 1 day)
* Hiking/coffee tour in the Blue Mountains
* Ocho Rios
* MoBay to fly out.

&#x200B;

We want to mostly be in smaller inns/hostels, eat local food, snorkle, swim, hike, see waterfalls, maybe raft.

In Costa Rica we went to Alajuela/Barva/Ciudad Quesada/La Fortuna/Tamarindo/Playa Hermosa (Guanacaste)/Quepos/Jaco/Alajuela over 2 weeks, but we had our own car. Also, it was a lot of driving. I have no illusion that mostly taking the bus will be less fast.",2,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamaicaTourism/comments/1bglprr/knutsford_route_taxis_is_my_itinerary_too/

MBJ Airport (MoBay) recently,"Two recent experiences, perhaps worth noting.   It can get super crowded or be fairly tolerable.  There is a rerouting of traffic for check-ins, so it can be a bit crazy getting dropped off. 

I went down on December 20th, and immigration was insane.   This was the worst I've seen it.  It took an hour to get through.   Even once I was through, it took another 45 minutes to collect my bags.   My friend was coming to drive us and he said it was the worst he'd seen it.   The traffic outside was crazy. 

On the other hand, coming back on Dec. 26th, it was a breeze getting through - hardly crowded at all.   I've seen departures with an incredibly long line backing up down the hallway for getting into security.  This had a tiny line in comparison.   

I'm guessing that the 20th was crowded because schools in the US and Canada just let out, and families were coming down.   There was also a large number of Jamaicans coming home for the holidays. 

Since the 26th was between holidays, few people were traveling.   

I'm not sure what advice to bring with this, but plan for a super long delay, which may not materialize.  I'm guessing that January 2nd and 3rd will be a mad-house. ",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamaicaTourism/comments/18s192n/mbj_airport_mobay_recently/

July trip off main path must dos,"Looking for recommendations for a short trip in July that avoids big tourist spots, but will only have a few days. Will be me and my best friend for her birthday. 

My intention (can be adjusted) is staying in Negril area as I’d prefer less touristy but not isolated, also looked at Treasure Beach but Negril seems to have a bit more to do. I like the beach but am more a fan of activities like scuba diving or snorkeling or unique things like the black sand / bioluminescence. I’m more inclide to want to see the waterfalls , hike to lagoons, do things vs just soak in then sun. 

That said a few questions- 
1) Is driving / a rental car a good move or risky? No issues driving in France or Belize but would never in my life consider trying to drive in Bali lol 😂 if no to a rental how expesive are car hires typically? Any trusted driver recommendations? 

2) What would you consider must do  experiences? Since I’ll be limited on days I’m trying to do can’t miss out on type things. Right now I’ve been looking at a horse back ridding/ bioluminescent tour and maybe diving the throne room but am otherwise open. Is the black sand worth seeing, are there any waterfalls / pools that are just as nice as Dunn but not stupid crowded? 

3) Any hotel recommendations? I’m not against all inclusive but not sure I’d fully benefit from one since it’s likely I’ll be doing things over lunch and not drinking a ton. I also don’t mind hoping around every 2 days if more suitable to experiences in different areas.

Looking for recommendations-Negril mini-moon/baby-moon,"Hi!

My husband and I never had our honeymoon (married March 2024) and are looking to mini-moon in April of this year. This will also be a babymoon, I'll be 20 weeks during this trip. I'm developing severe decision paralysis while trying to book this so last minute.

We would like to stay away from AI. Cliff style is very cool but I'm leaning towards beach walk-up access to avoid having to drive to the beach everyday. (Maybe we'll visit Rick's Cafe to get the cliff experience.)

I'm struggling now to decide between more affordable/authentic and home-style experiences with places like County Country or something more luxurious to treat ourselves. We will want to do a lot of exploring for local food.

We want to rent a car so that we can do the drive from Montego bay on our own. Thoughts? We will need to be able to park in this case.

Any ideas?

Edit: Edit to add that I lived in Jamaica (Montego Bay) for 6 months in 2006. I haven't been back to Jamaica since 2008. In 2008, I rented a car and made a day trip to Negril.

Visiting Jamaica as blind people,"Hey guys, my girlfriend and I are considering visiting Jamaica in December for her birthday and I’m just trying to get some information to best navigate this. Some background. I am a born and raised Trinidadian. She is born and raised British. We are both blind. We are both comfortable with international travel; her and her family have travelled many times and she has travelled independently. I’ve also done some international travel on my own. She has been to Trinidad several times so as far as Trinidad goes, she grasps the difference between the Caribbean and England. Obviously, Trinidad and Tobago does not represent every island and we cannot use Trinidad to cover Jamaica. First question. From November to February, how is the weather? In Trinidad, it’s gonna be rainy at that time. In terms of beaches and other natural attractions, would they be good at that time? Transportation. How do you guys get around? In the UK, we rely on Uber. In Trinidad, you have to flag down a taxi, go to the taxi stand and catch a car, or if you know a taxi driver, you can hire them, but that comes at a higher price. Digital payments. How widespread is the adoption of payments via debit and credit cards? If we need cash, where can we obtain cash at a good exchange rate. Is Apple Pay accepted? Crime. I’m really not trying to offend anyone here, but I just want to understand. In Trinidad, there are certain areas I will not take you, even if you beg and plead and really want to go. Not because I don’t want to carry you, but For your own safety. How is the crime scene in Jamaica? Is it widespread, isolated to certain areas? Obviously, listening to dancehall you get the impression that crime is everywhere and there’s always wild parties with people arguing shooting popping Molly and having sex… LOL But I really want to understand the day-to-day life. Areas to avoid, areas where we should be… I don’t know and I want to understand. Resorts. What are your resorts like? Do you have all inclusive resorts? I would love some real life experiences about resorts in Jamaica.

Healthcare. I am type one diabetic. I always pack double the amount of medication I need. But in the event of something going wrong, is there a resource where I can see the insulin types available in Jamaica? Lastly… Whilst we are there, What would you guys say we should definitely do and try? For some context, we both love music, being outdoors, testing food, the beach, interacting with people, alcohol, intelligent conversation, fitness and just having a good time.",1,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamaicaTourism/comments/1j482jl/visiting_jamaica_as_blind_people/

Access fee to Frenchman's Cove and other beaches in Portland,"Currently planning a trip to Jamaica with my wife and two very young children, and I'd figured that Frenchman's Cove was perfect for us (we are looking for a small quiet place away from Negril, Montego Bay, Ocho Rios). But I just found out that Frenchman's Cove is private and that one has to pay 2,500 Jamaican dollars per person to access it. The site also says the fee will be updated in ""January 2024"" so maybe now it's more ( [https://frenchmanscove.com/world-famous-beach/#:\~:text=for%20an%20event%3F-,Yes.,assist%20in%20making%20this%20arrangement](https://frenchmanscove.com/world-famous-beach/#:~:text=for%20an%20event%3F-,Yes.,assist%20in%20making%20this%20arrangement) ). To recap that's about $16 USD per person, so two people going to beach every day for 10 days would mean some $320 in beach fees alone. Kids under 4 enter for free but that still seems like a lot of money. Was wondering if anyone can confirm the fee for Frenchman's Cove and what you all think about this ""private beach"" thing, which sounds ethically questionable, as it effectively prices out the vast majority of Jamaicans. Are there any other small coves and beaches in Portland parish you would recommend for a more authentic experience?

Would it be smarter to rent a car for the three days or taxi around? I live in the US and have never driven on the left side of the road but I feel like I could figure it out easy enough.  

  
Also, I know Feb 6th of this year would have been Bob's 80th birthday, and I was wondering if there are any events planned on the island to celebrate this? Love reggae, dub and sound system culture, was hoping to peak around for some music to dance to. 

  
Also any recs on nature spots I should check out in the area? I'm not opposed to staying in multiple locations throughout the weekend.

**Looking for:**

* Nice beachfront resort or hotel. Size doesn't matter and AI doesn't matter. Just has to be nice and peaceful
* Proximity to **SERENE** world class beach(es) and beach related activities
* Access to good local food and exposure to local culture 

**Nice to have/avoid:**

* Proximity to excursions or day trips (preferably less touristy but still accessible) 
* Little to no children around
* Some nightlife is fine, if not preferred, but we don't want to stay around the party or the youths
* Diversity of people around

Odd request but after this keychain from an Ocho Rios shop,"We just left Jamaica after going for vacation and to see family. My dad's cousins gave us a little basket with some souvenirs, just cute keychains and stuff. It was a lovely trip and my first time getting to go (so don't foresee another trip any time soon lol)

Two of the keychains were these super cute enamel shoes. One was claimed by my cousin, and his dad (my aunt's husband) liked the other but let me take it. I could tell he really wanted it though 😭 despite looking long and hard, only the same typical Jamaica keychains were available online

But googling the tag led me to this souvenir store:
Divi Wholesale 
54 Main St, Ocho Rios, Jamaica

I pictured the one I have and some similar ones from their shop's Google listing. I would want the tennis shoe one. They had this color and then one with the Jamaica flag colors too. I'd love both if possible but would be happy with either!

My family is in Kingston so they would have had to buy these some time ago on an Ocho Rios trip. Don't know when they'd go back (plus idk about mailing a single keychain from Jamaica to TX) so thought I'd ask if anyone here on vacation could grab me one and mail it back to me when you return to the states? I'd happily compensate for the mail, keychains, and a little more for your time

My question is: Is there any way to fly directly into Negril, or is the two-hour drive from Montego Bay the only option? Also, any hotel recommendations would be greatly appreciated! We’re looking for a two-bedroom suite with excellent food, but without waterslides.

Thank you for any help!",0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamaicaTourism/comments/1gqk7ew/family_trip_to_jamaica/
Bus MTB to Kingston?,"Hello, I'm going to Jamaica in January, flying to Montego Bay (my only choice) then having to make the 4.5 hour trip to my hotel in Kingston.  Can I get off the plane, go through customs (I'm paying extra for easy-entry) and get on the Bus at 2, 3, 6 PM. Will I be harassed or have my stuff stolen like Ivan did in THTC?  What if I arrive at the bus station in Kingston at midnight?   Will I get a cab home (the hotel will probably send).  One (black) friend of mine who goes often to Jamaica says Kingston is malevolent, do not even think of street dancehall event.  Really, as a male 65 y.o. veteran traveler, what. me worry? (or not?).

Walking Canes/ Wood Work ?,"Greetings,



A few years ago I came back from [Negril](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g147313-Negril_Westmoreland_Parish_Jamaica-Vacations.html) with two beautiful walking canes which I use for a disability. Unfortunately I had to leave them behind when I moved.

Will be headed to [Jamaica](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g147309-Jamaica-Vacations.html) soon when the weather changes but want to try the other side of the island Kingston/ Port Antonio. I see the Kingston Crafts Market on YouTube but no woodwork items like Negril crafts market is seems. I don't know if Port Antonio will be any better. I would hate to come back empty handed.

In Negril there were obvious woodworkers that had almost a gallery experience in their shop. Is this a Negril thing only or can you find similar shops all over Jamaica ? I am looking for a talented woodworker to make me custom canes.

Any idea where would be the ideal place to look ?

Thanks so much.

My friends and I are gearing up for a 12-day trip to Jamaica and could use some advice on where to stay.

Our main goal is to explore the island's stunning landscapes and beaches, but we're also open to guided experiences. Any suggestions on striking the right balance between nature and convenience?

Day in Kingston,"Hi,
My partner and I are trying to plan if it's worth spending a day in Kingston before our evening flight.
The knutsford express arrives in Kingston at 10:30am and our flight isn't until 8pm so we thought we could spend the day seeing the Bob Marley museum/Devon house. The only issue is we'll have our bags with all of our stuff for the whole holiday with us. 
Are there any safe luggage storage facilities near these locations? Or do you think we could pay to leave them at a hotel nearby if we also come back there for food/drinks etc?
Our alternative is to stay in port Antonio for the day and get a taxi straight to the airport in the afternoon. 

Any suggestions do let us know!
Thanks",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamaicaTourism/comments/1ajlqqw/day_in_kingston/

Help Us Plan the Ultimate Jamaica Trip – Celebrating 25 Years of Friendship!,"Hey everyone! My best friend and I are celebrating 25 years of friendship with an epic trip to Jamaica in the 3rd week of February 2028! We live in Canada and are terrible at planning trips, so we need all the advice we can get to make this the best experience of our lives.

We want this trip to be fully planned in advance so we don’t have to make decisions on the spot—we just want to follow the itinerary and live our best lives. We’re saving up now to make it special, and we want to feel like queens while truly experiencing the beauty and culture of Jamaica.

What we need advice on:

1. Best way to get there from Canada (affordable flights, best routes, any tips?)

2. Where to stay – Hotels vs. Airbnb? We want comfort but also an unforgettable experience.

3. Getting around – What’s the best and most affordable way to commute within Jamaica? Should we rent a car? Is it easy/safe for tourists to drive?

4. Food! – We want to experience authentic Jamaican cuisine. Where do locals go? Affordable hidden gems? Must-try dishes?

5. Activities & experiences – We don’t want a single dull moment! We want scenic views, cultural experiences, and fun and excitement without the typical tourist traps.

6. Luxury & relaxation – We’re not into alcohol or smoking, but we want to be pampered! Spa recommendations? Unique luxury experiences that are worth it?

7. Best scenic spots – I’ve seen breathtaking pictures of Jamaica, and I want to be right in the middle of that beauty. Where should we go?

If you've done a trip like this or live in Jamaica, please share all your wisdom! Where should we go, what should we avoid, and how do we get the best experience without wasting time?

Thank you in advance! We’re beyond excited and want to make this the trip of a lifetime!",0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamaicaTourism/comments/1jh82bw/help_us_plan_the_ultimate_jamaica_trip/
